# DianaPLC GitHub Pages Site

> Based on code initially generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.7.

This repo holds the code for my personal website on GitHub pages, but is also a sandbox for experimenting with various projects and frameworks. The current iteration uses Angular not because the site requires it but because I wanted to experiment with it.

## To-Do
- [x] Initial app generation
- [x] Basic styling and content for 1 page
- [x] Simple test coverage
- [ ] Update "About" section
- [ ] Add skills, MS study details
- [ ] Add portfolio view
- [ ] Add show/hide functionality to experience section
- [ ] Add contact form

## Develop
> Based on auto-generated Angular readme

### Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Deploy
To deploy, run:

```bash
ng deploy
```
